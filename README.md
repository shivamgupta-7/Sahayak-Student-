An international student's transition to a new country is arduous, and the problems begin the moment they arrive. 
Finding accommodation, understanding courses, and communicating with classmates and seniors are among the 
most difficult difficulties. 63 percent of international students found it difficult to find roommates and residences, 
according to user data acquired through surveys. Around 80% of students expressed an interest in learning more 
about the courses available this semester as well as interacting with other students. 83 percent of students had 
little to no clue where they would continue their studies or what they should do first (University ID, introductory 
events, student club inaugurals, etc.) As a result, we intend to develop an app that will allow a potential user to 
To overcome overwhelming challenges and gain a comprehensive experience as an international student, 
communicate with others, and seek aid on the app. Our app will help students find the greatest fit for their needs 
by allowing them to search for and submit information about apartments, whether they are looking for a new lease 
or a sublet. Students can also use the app to acquire reviews and information about lodgings. Aside from that, 
students may keep a lookout for their peers and learn about course material before selecting one, as well as 
communicate with others who have completed or are currently enrolled in the course using the app, making the 
processes less complex and time-consuming. Not only that, also our app keeps its users up to date on current 
on-campus events, giving international students a place to interact with new people, join new groups, meet new 
people, and have fun, making their international student experience easier.
